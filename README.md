# Lakylelyttle2019.github.io
Let me begin by saying I started this simply because i went to github.io instead of github.com
you know the whole just press enter once you entered in most of the link thing..
Ended looking further into it and made this site eventually


Note this is where I start to act serious..

First Off I do not care what you do with any of the programming found in this repository, I made it public for a reason.. If you ever feel the need to mention me do it under the name Snipeshootings not the school email name that I was told to make a github account under.
This is just a quick note I wanted to do 5mins from morning for myself and those that end up actually looking at this..
